  description: |+
    This NLP microservice recovers the missing punctuations such as full stop, comma, exclamation mark, and question mark from the input text.
    
    It converts pre-defined abbreviations from lower case to upper case and also first letters of sentences to upper case.
    
    Do ensure that your text is within **5000 characters**.
