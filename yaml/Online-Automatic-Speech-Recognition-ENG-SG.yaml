            This microservice takes in an audio stream (in .wav format at 16kHz) and transcribes any speech content within the stream into text.

          <p>
            The ASR AI model is a neural network employed to understand the mapping of sound features to actual words in English and is trained to
            perform well on a Singaporean-accented English speaker. It is also expected to perform better when the speech content is related to generic news topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            This ASR model should also work for other content types and accents but with a lower accuracy.
            One potential use cases is the live transcription of call center recordings.
